            Hi, my name is Juliette Amador and welcome to my page! I was born on May 6, 1994, in Miami, Florida. I am the third child of Juan and Ivette Amador. Five years after giving birth to me, my younger sister Daniella was born. Together, my parents have four daughters: Erica, Jessica, myself and Daniella. 
            I am 24 years old and I graduated from Florida State University in 2016 with a degree in Marketing adn Hospitality. I enrolled in coding bootcamp because I want a career change and strive to become a business analyst.

            Throughout my life I danced and did cheerleading. However, as I got older I realized cheering was no longer for me. Today, I exercise often by participating in yoga and group exercise classes. I enjoy exercising because it's time to myself and it helps me relax. I often find myself rushing out of work to ensure I do not miss my favorite yoga class. Fitting in exercise after work leaves me in a better mood and ready to relax when I get home. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, I love exercising and technology. Currently, I work at a design firm, Hospitality Purveyors as a Design Administator. By completely coding bootcamp, I hope to make a career change into the tech field.
